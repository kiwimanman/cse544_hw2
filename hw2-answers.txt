2. B.

The various properties for the insured relationship between Vehicle and Insurance Co live in the Vehicle table.
This is due to the one to many counting. The foreign key lives here in the property called insured_by.
The other two properties, maxLossDamage and maxLiability, both also live on vehicle due to being one to one with the
foreign key insured_by.

2. C. 

Operates is a one-to-many relationship between Truck and nonProfessionalDriver. The foreign key lives on the truck
as the operated_by property in the schema.

Drives is a many-to-many relationship and requires a seperate table to model correctly in the schema. This table is
called Cars_nonProfessionalDrivers and contains an id field as a primary key and two attributes licencePlate and licenceNo
which are foreign key for the Car(licencePlate) and nonProfessionalDriver(licenceNo) respectively.
